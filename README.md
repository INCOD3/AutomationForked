# Automatic Forker for GitHub

The Automatic Forker for GitHub is a Python tool that automates the process of forking GitHub repositories, following recursive forks to create a cascade of forks network.

## Key Features:

- **Automatic Forking:** Automatically fork a GitHub repository based on your GitHub username.

- **Recursive Forks:** Follow recursive forks to fork all repositories in the forks network.

- **Avoid Duplicates:** Avoid creating duplicate forks in repositories you have already forked.

- **Easy Configuration:** Quickly set up your GitHub personal access token and username through console interaction.

## How to Use:

1. Clone this repository to your local environment.

2. Run the provided Python script.

3. Follow the instructions in the console to set up your GitHub personal access token and username.

4. The script will fork the repository of your own username and follow recursive forks, avoiding duplicates.

## Prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- A GitHub personal access token with permissions to fork repositories.

## Important Note:

- Be sure to use your GitHub personal access token with care and do not share it publicly.

- Note that GitHub may have API usage rate limitations. Be sure to respect these limits to avoid disruptions in the process.
